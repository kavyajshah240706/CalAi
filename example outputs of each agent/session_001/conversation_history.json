      "content": "For a light and healthy dinner, you might want to try a grilled salmon salad. It's packed with nutrients and is satisfying without being too heavy. Here's a simple idea:\n\n- **Grilled Salmon**: Season a salmon fillet with some lemon juice, salt, pepper, and dill. Grill it until it's cooked through.\n- **Salad Base**: Use a mix of greens like spinach, arugula, and kale.\n- **Toppings**: Add sliced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, red onions, and avocado for healthy fats.\n- **Dressing**: A light vinaigrette made with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and a touch of mustard can complement the dish well.\n\nThis meal is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, making it a great choice for a healthy dinner. Enjoy your meal!",

      "reasoning": "The dish involves marinating chicken in a mixture of olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, and spices, then grilling it. The marinade is boiled and strained to create a sauce. During grilling, the chicken loses some water content, concentrating its flavors. The sauce, made from the marinade, adds moisture and flavor back to the dish. The final product is a combination of grilled chicken and the savory sauce.",

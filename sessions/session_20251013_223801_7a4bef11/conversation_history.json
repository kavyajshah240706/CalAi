You can replace part of it with a whole grain option like quinoa or brown rice for additional fiber and nutrients.\n\n2. **Increase Vegetables:** Add more vegetables to your meal. Options like broccoli, spinach, or bell peppers can enhance the nutritional profile with more vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n\n3. **Sauce Consideration:** If the brown sauce is store-bought, check for added sugars or high sodium content. You could make a homemade version with reduced sodium soy sauce and natural spices.\n\n4. **Lean Protein:** Ensure the chicken is skinless to reduce fat content. Alternatively, you can add legumes or tofu for variety in protein sources.\n\n5. **Healthy Fats:** Incorporate healthy fats, such as a small amount of avocado or olive oil, to balance the meal's fat profile.\n\nThese adjustments can help make your meal more balanced and nutritious.",
